### **Assistant Professor**  
**July 2021 â€“ Present**  

As an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Suzhou University of Science and Technology, I lead courses in optimization theory, operations research, and mathematical modeling while developing innovative teaching methods for core mathematics curricula. My research focuses on advancing nonlinear optimization techniques, particularly in designing efficient algorithms for least constraint violation problems and improving sequential quadratic programming methods. I collaborate extensively with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to develop practical optimization toolkits and analyze convergence properties in nonconvex optimization scenarios.
